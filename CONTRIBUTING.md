# Contribution Guidelines
Your contributions mean alot to us, so we want to get you started with a few guidelines before you begin.
# Issues
If you find a bug or wish to suggest a feature for the app, you are welcome to open an issue. We do, however, ask that you visit our Help page on our website and read the Troubleshooting section before opening an issue. We want to limit the amount of issues opened on the repository that we have already addressed. While it is not imperative, we prefer if issue submissions adhere to the following template
- List what platform you are on (iOS or Android) and the tablet you have (i.e. iPad Air, Samsung Galaxy Tab E)
- Describe the bug/feature you would like us to implement
- If it is a bug, describe how it occured and under what conditions (i.e. I attempted to add a photo by URL and the app crashed).
We also recommend that you apply the appropriate labels when submitting
# Pull Requests
If you wish to make a change or fix an issue, fork the repository and make a branch. Please avoid working directly on master. After you are certain that your change is stable, you can submit a pull request. Title the request with a breif description of your fix or addition. In the description, tell us breifly what issue you solved/feature you added, as well as how your addition fixes the problem/enhances the app. After that, you can submit it for approval. We will try to get back to you and give you feedback as soon as we can.
