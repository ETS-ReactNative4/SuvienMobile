# SuvienMobile
Welcome to Suvien 2.0! The app that takes you and your loved ones on a trip down memory lane. This repository was created in the development of the application, and serves as a place where issues can be opened, language support can be updated, and developers can contribute their insights on Suvien's implementation. 
# Information About Suvien 2.0
Suvien 2.0 was created using [JavaScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript), [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), and [React Native](http://facebook.github.io/react-native/). Many of Suvien's features also rely on custom libraries created by the React Native community. A comprehensive list of them are below along with the links to their respective repositories.
- [react-native-orientation](https://github.com/yamill/react-native-orientation)
- [react-native-musicplayercontroller](https://github.com/KjellConnelly/react-native-musicplayercontroller)
- [react-native-camera](https://github.com/lwansbrough/react-native-camera)
- [react-native-video](https://github.com/react-native-community/react-native-video)

**Note - Many of these libraries' code was changed in order to fit Suvien 2.0's needs. Running npm install on these libraries without replacing the files with the ones in the ModifiedNodeFiles folder afterwards will cause Suvien to crash upon running.**
**Please consult our [Setup guide](SETUP.md) before attempting to debug**
